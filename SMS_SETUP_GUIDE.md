# SMS OTP Service Setup Guide - ToolNTask

## üî• FINAL WORKING SMS OTP SOLUTION 

This document provides the complete setup for real SMS OTP delivery using Twilio for the ToolNTask authentication system.

## üìã Current Status

‚úÖ **COMPLETED:**
- Phone verification API with real SMS support
- Twilio SMS integration implemented
- Email fallback for development mode
- OTP generation and storage in Firestore
- Phone number validation for Sri Lankan numbers (070-078 series)
- Professional error handling and user feedback

üîß **TO ENABLE REAL SMS:**
1. Set up Twilio account and get credentials
2. Add environment variables
3. Test with real phone numbers

## üöÄ How to Enable Real SMS Service

### Step 1: Create Twilio Account
1. Go to [https://www.twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email and phone number
4. You'll get $15 in free credits for testing

### Step 2: Get Twilio Credentials
1. Login to [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. From the main dashboard, copy:
   - **Account SID** (starts with AC...)
   - **Auth Token** (click to reveal)

### Step 3: Get a Twilio Phone Number
1. In Twilio Console, go to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Buy a number**
2. Select your country (or US for international)
3. Choose a number with SMS capability
4. Purchase the number (costs ~$1/month)

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Twilio SMS Service Configuration
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_actual_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
```

### Step 5: Test the SMS Service
1. Restart your Next.js development server
2. Go to forgot password page
3. Enter a real phone number
4. You should receive an actual SMS!

## üì± How the SMS System Works

### Current Implementation:
- **With Twilio credentials**: Sends real SMS to user's phone
- **Without Twilio credentials**: Falls back to email simulation for development
- **Phone validation**: Only accepts Sri Lankan mobile numbers (070-078 series)
- **OTP expiry**: Codes expire in 10 minutes
- **Security**: Codes are 6-digit random numbers

### SMS Message Format:
```
üîê Your ToolNTask verification code is: 123456. This code expires in 10 minutes. Don't share this code with anyone. - ToolNTask Sri Lanka
```

## üîí Security Features

1. **Phone Validation**: Only Sri Lankan mobile numbers accepted
2. **OTP Expiry**: 10-minute expiration window
3. **Secure Storage**: OTPs stored in Firebase Firestore with timestamps
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built into Twilio (1 SMS per second by default)
5. **No Code Reuse**: Each OTP can only be verified once

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Twilio Pricing (as of 2024):
- **Phone Number**: ~$1.00/month
- **SMS Messages**: $0.0075 per SMS (less than 1 cent per message)
- **Free Trial**: $15 credit includes ~2000 SMS messages

### Monthly Cost Estimate:
- 100 password resets = 100 SMS = $0.75
- 500 password resets = 500 SMS = $3.75
- 1000 password resets = 1000 SMS = $7.50
- Plus $1/month for phone number

## üåç International SMS Support

The current system supports:
- **Sri Lankan Numbers**: 070, 071, 072, 074, 075, 076, 077, 078 series
- **International Format**: +94 prefix required
- **Validation**: Automatic formatting and validation

To add other countries:
1. Update phone validation patterns in `phone-verify.ts`
2. Add country-specific formatting in `formatPhoneNumber()`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **SMS not received**:
   - Check Twilio credentials are correct
   - Verify phone number format (+94xxxxxxxxx)
   - Check Twilio console for delivery status

2. **"Development Mode" message**:
   - Twilio environment variables not set
   - Check `.env.local` file exists and has correct variables
   - Restart development server after adding variables

3. **Phone validation errors**:
   - Only 070-078 series Sri Lankan numbers supported
   - Must start with 0 (converts to +94) or +94

### Debug Steps:
1. Check server console for logs
2. Verify environment variables: `console.log(process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID)`
3. Test with Twilio's phone number lookup tool
4. Check Twilio console logs for delivery status

## üìù API Endpoints

## üîÑ Development vs Production

### Development Mode (No Twilio credentials):

- Full OTP verification still works
- Perfect for testing without SMS costs

### Production Mode (With Twilio credentials):
- Sends real SMS to user's phone
- Professional user experience
- Real-time SMS delivery
- Production-ready security
